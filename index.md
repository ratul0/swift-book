# Swift & iOS Development: From Fundamentals to Production

Welcome to your comprehensive guide for mastering Swift and iOS development. This book is structured to take you from Swift's foundational concepts through advanced production-ready patterns, with a special focus on practical iOS application development.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Build

By the end of this book, you'll have the knowledge to build production-quality iOS apps including:
- Health & fitness tracking applications using HealthKit
- Data-driven apps with SwiftData persistence
- Responsive interfaces with SwiftUI's modern declarative syntax
- Concurrent, performant apps using Swift's async/await
- Well-tested, maintainable codebases following Apple's best practices

#### [Chapter 10: Type Safety Features](./10%20-%20Type%20Safety%20Features.md)
Explore compile-time safety features, type checking, pattern matching, and Swift's approach to preventing runtime errors.

### Part V: Modern Concurrency

#### [Chapter 11: Modern Concurrency](./11%20-%20Modern%20Concurrency.md)
Master async/await, Tasks, continuations, and Swift's approach to asynchronous programming without callbacks.

#### [Chapter 12: Structured Concurrency](./12%20-%20Structured%20Concurrency.md)
Learn Task groups, async sequences, Actors for thread-safe state management, and building concurrent systems.

### Part VI: Properties & Collections

#### [Chapter 13: Property Wrappers and Observers](./13%20-%20Property%20Wrappers%20and%20Observers.md)
Understand property wrappers (@State, @Published), willSet/didSet observers, and creating custom property wrappers.

#### [Chapter 14: Advanced Property Concepts](./14%20-%20Advanced%20Property%20Concepts.md)
Deep dive into computed properties, property wrapper composition, and advanced property patterns.

#### [Chapter 15: Standard Collections](./15%20-%20Standard%20Collections.md)
Master Arrays, Sets, Dictionaries, their performance characteristics, and when to use each collection type.

#### [Chapter 16: Advanced Collection Operations](./16%20-%20Advanced%20Collection%20Operations.md)
Learn collection protocols, custom collections, lazy collections, and advanced algorithms for data manipulation.

### Part VII: SwiftUI Development

#### [Chapter 17: SwiftUI State Management for iOS](./17%20-%20SwiftUI%20State%20Management%20for%20iOS.md)
